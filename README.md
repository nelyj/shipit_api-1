Shipit API
===========

The Shipit API gem allows Ruby developers to access to admin information of Shipit client account.

The API is implemented as JSON over HTTP using all four verbs (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE(. Each resource like Package, SKU or Quotation has
its own URL and is manipulated in isolation. In other words, we've tried to make the API follow the REST principles as much as possible.
