Shipit API
===========

The Shipit API gem allows Ruby developers to access to admin information of Shipit client account.

The API is implemented as JSON over HTTP using all four verbs (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE(. Each resource like Package, SKU or Quotation has
its own URL and is manipulated in isolation. In other words, we've tried to make the API follow the REST principles as much as possible.

## Usage
### Requirements

* Create an account into https://shipit.cl
* Sign in into https://clientes.shipit.cl/accounts/sign_in
* Get the email and token from section: Inicio -> API

### Sandbox

By default sandbox is false. If you need to active sandbox contact us. (integraciones@shipit.cl)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'shipit_api', '~> 0.1.1'
```
And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install shipit_api

After that create a file with name `shipit.rb` inside `initializer` directory with the next code:

```ruby
 ShipitAPI::Config.setup do |config|
    config.x_shipit_email = 'YOUR_ACCOUNT_EMAIL'
    config.x_shipit_token = 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'
 end
```

Well done, You can use `ShipitAPI` in your application :D
